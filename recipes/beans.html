        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cook bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate. Cool, then crumble.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, add ground beef and onions to a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until beef is no longer pink, breaking it apart as it cooks, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Transfer beef and onions to a large Dutch oven. Stir in crumbled bacon, pork and beans, barbecue sauce, kidney beans, lima beans, black beans, brown sugar, cider vinegar, liquid smoke, salt, and black pepper.
        </li>
