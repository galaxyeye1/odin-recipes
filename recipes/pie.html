    <h2>Description</h2>
    <span>Not too many people would know this spaghetti squash pie is not actually made with coconut. I wasn't sure what to do with a bumper crop of spaghetti squash and this quickly became an annual answer to a now non-issue!</span>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 cups cooked, shredded spaghetti squash</li>
        <li>1 (9 inch) pie shell, baked</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups whipped cream for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Beat sugar and eggs together in a mixing bowl until light and frothy. Beat in butter, lemon juice, and vanilla until well blended. Stir in spaghetti squash.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into prebaked pie shell. Dust the top with nutmeg and cinnamon.
        </li>
        <li>Bake the pie in the preheated oven until a knife inserted in the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool on a rack before serving.
        </li>
        <li>Garnish with whipped cream.
        </li>
    </ol>
